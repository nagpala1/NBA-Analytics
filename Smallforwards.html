				<div id="para">The SF position has become an integral part of basketball, with the last 5 finals MVP's being crowned to a wing. The best 3 do not only seperate themselves from every other forward, but perhaps also every other player..

				<div id="text1">Lebron is the best player in the game and has been for quite some time now. 7 straight NBA finals appearances and the greatest finals comeback in NBA history, James' place as one of the GOAT's has already been solidified. <br><br> Overall ranking: 1st
				</div>
				<div id="text2">We knew this man would have a huge target on his back since the very first day of his free agency decision. Make no mistake, as much hate as he gets, what he brings to the table cannot be mimicked by any other player. <br><br> Overall ranking: 2nd
				</div>
				<div id="text3">Leonard is the Spurs past, present, and future. He is the best 2-way player in the game today, with a ton of potential still untapped. Had it not been for an untimely ankle injury, you can bet your house he would have given the Warriors a run for their monies'. <br><br> Overall ranking: 3rd
