				<div id="text1">AD can dominate the stat sheet like no other, but he has yet to experience winning success. Part of that is due to the minimal capabilies of his supporting cast. Another part is due to injuries. In order to take the next step, AD must secure a playoff berth and obtain a playoff victory.  <br><br> Overall ranking: 8th
				</div>
				<div id="text2">Injured the previous 2 post-seasons, Blake's stock has taken a tumble. However, he is still one of the best 4's in the game today. The biggest concern with Griffin is his health. When he's 100%, his level of impact is among the very best. <br><br> Overall ranking: 19th
				</div>
				<div id="text3">Love's 3rd season with the Cavs was his best one yet with the organization. He got back to doing what he does best, and that's playing a tough, fundamentally sound brand of basketball. In a quest to repeat, Kevin's level of production will be vital. <br><br> Overall ranking: 28th
